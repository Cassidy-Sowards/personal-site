Almost all of this code was written by me following the tailwindcss.com documentation
However, I did use some resources for implementing dark mode including:
https://flowbite.com/docs/forms/toggle/ for the toggle switch
https://www.section.io/engineering-education/implementing-dark-mode-using-tailwind-css/ for a clearer explanation on how to implement dark mode using Tailwind
